# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
This analysis helps Pewlett Hackard, a large company boasting several thousand employees, plan for the future as many employees begin to retire rapidly. The analysis includes two main tasks:

1. Determine the number of retiring employees per title
2. Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program

## Results:

The analysis results of task 1 (to determine the number of retiring employee per title) shows that 72,458 employees are retiring soon. The majority of retiring people are engineers (18,174), followed by Senrio Staff (16,406), and the lowest number of retiring employees are with manager titles (only 3). The image below shows a summary table of retiring employees by title.

Task 2 is to identify retiring employees who are eligible for participation in a mentorship program. The results show that 1,940 employees are eligible for the mentorship program. 

## Summary: 
Two main conclusions can be drawn from the analysis results:

1. A total of 72,458 roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact
2. There are 1,940 retirement-ready employees to mentor the next generation of Pawlett Hackard employees
